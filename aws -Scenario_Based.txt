Scenario Based Question(Inside AWS ec2 linux machine)

commands:

       sudo yum update
       sudo yum install docker
       sudo yum install git -y


1.Write Docker file to create an image with the apache httpd2 server make the start of the httpd2 server as the container entry point.


	FROM ubuntu:latest
        RUN apt-get -y update
        RUN apt-get install -y apache2 
        RUN apt-get install -y apache2-utils
        EXPOSE 80
        COPY index.html /var/www/html/index.html
        ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl"]
        CMD ["-D","FOREGROUND"]


2.Create an git repository with index.html files for our webserver, clone the repo to an local linux machine.


       sudo git clone git@github.com:vignesh-vl/demowebpages.git


3.Create an bash script which will pull the contents from the GitHub Repo every 5 hours (use Linux Cron) to the local cloned repo, The script should log all these activities to an log file with timestamp (file which keep track of all script runs)



       pull.sh
       git pull
       head -n 1 /var/log/lastlog/ >> log.txt
       date>>log.txt

       crontab -l
       * */5 * * * pull.sh


4.Spin up the container out of the image you create from the docker file, expose the port 80, mount the dir where you have cloned the git repo to the dir inside the container from where httpd2 server reads the HTML files (/var/www/html)


      sudo docker run -p 80:80 -v /home/ec2-user/demowebpages:/var/www/html myserver
