If [-e “child.sh ]
then
sudo chmod a+x  child.sh
  ./child.sh 12
else
 echo "child.sh not exist in current directory" 
fi

child.sh

sum=0
count=0
for (( i=2;i<=$1;i++ ))
do
 count=0
 for(( j=2;j<$i;j++ ))
 do
  if (( $i % j == 0 ))
  then
      count=1
      # echo $i
  fi
 done
 if (( $count == 0 ))
 then 
    sum=$((sum+i))
 fi
done   
echo $sum
